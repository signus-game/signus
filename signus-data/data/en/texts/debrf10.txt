#> The mission was accomplished according to the plan. The defile was captured and the
 enemy was eliminated. On our way back to Trixon we were outflanked by an earthquake.
 We could see clouds of steam coming out from the ground. First of all we considered it a
 new technology of Consortium or something of this kind. But the outflowing gas did not
 cause us any harm.
#> There were no more problems on the rest of our way.
