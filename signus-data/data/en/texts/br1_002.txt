#> Commando Signus
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> This project was proposed by Ian Zening - the director of the Tricon´s defence division.
 He gained the support of the headquarters after the first diplomatic conflict between Toricon and
 the Consortium has happened. After finding out the fact that Consortium is undertaking research
 expeditions to those forbidden territories  that are in the sphere of Toricon´s interest, the existence
 of this project became a necessity.
#> The task is to create the unit of top army units - the Signus commando. Its purpose is to gain the
 forbidden territories, where Toricon plans to work on the research of the artefacts, test recently
 invented weapons, limit the influence of Consortium in these mentioned areas using assault troops,
 liquidation of relevant witnesses etc.
#> The members of the commando are forced to undergo the introductory tests: physical, psychical
 etc. Than they have to pass through a training where they are taught to deal with various arsenal -
 depending on the specialisation based on the introductory tests results or a special military
 training.
#> On the proposal of the supply director Zening every member of Signus has a seeking code
 implanted under the skin. With the soldiers' agreement of course. The code is considered some
 kind of a badge of their membership in the top of the top...
 Toricon hopes well of this project because it is the first one of it's kind.
