#> We have tried to hold the base as long as possible, according to the command. While the
 expecting ship has been moving to the port, we have received a SOS signal from Ardenor
 from which we understood that the promised reinforcements will not come. Under the
 pressure of these circumstances, I was forced to release a command to retreat and transport
 the artefacts to the port.
#> With considerable casualties we have succeeded to embark on a warship Artemis and we,
 the ones that have survived, are moving to Tankred.
 Rufion was captured by the enemy. Ardenor, against which Consortium has started an
 attack before the invest of Rufion, is also without any chance.
#> However, the main aim of this mission - the shipping of artefact was fulfilled...
