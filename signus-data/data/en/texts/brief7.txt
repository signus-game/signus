#> The primary aim of this mission is to eliminate the enemy base Setrix south-west from our
 position.
#> During this mission we count on the use of a still existing connection between the forts - the
 railways.
#> The railway track runs through the Lebaran area and it is in perfect condition, so there
 should not be any complications from this aspect. The trains are just being finished by the
 constructors in our workshops. We will be using the new types of army train Mohykan.
 According to the news, the Consortium's units are moving with lightning speed and the
 liquidation of Setrix affords the opportunity to stop the attackers from penetration to other
 areas of Toricon. At least for a certain period of time.
