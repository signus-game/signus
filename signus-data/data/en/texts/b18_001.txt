#> Welcome to the Tridi Vision war news.
#> ■
#> Several hours ago, the last shots announcing the victory of Toricon in the biggest battle in
 history of Arconis have died out.
#> Although Consortium was defeated in this battle, we cannot talk about the end of the war
 yet. While there was a fight going on eight miles northward, the units of Rotenalia
 succeeded to slip into Trufat and solve the problem of insufficient provisions which would
 threat in case of siege. The victory of the attacking side thus isn't that clear as it seemed to
 be right after the battle.
#> In the mean time the burying of the casualties into mass graves and transport of hit units
 towards Trufat is going on. In the probably last military operation we count on the
 engaging of special units with code name Signus. Toricon has been using them mostly for
 the local assault actions and recently developed weapons testing. According to the
 unconfirmed source, Signus was partaking in the Amenur massacre, which became the
 gratest pretence for an open war.
