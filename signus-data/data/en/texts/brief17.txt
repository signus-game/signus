#> Port Luton, western Sotona
#> ■
#> Probably the most important mission of this war conflict and of your whole life is near you.
#> Toricon is about to realize an offence, which could change the final course of the war. After
 several failures, Toricon has finally succeeded to defeat Consortium and to open the access
 to the Liston coast for own ships. The mobilization of all the forces is happening right now
 to let Toricon deal a deadly blow to its antagonist. To do this, Toricon needs a territory in
 the enemy area, where it could gather its units for the critical battle. You are expected to
 take care of this problem as soon as possible.
#> The disembarkment will happen at the north-eastern coast three hours after the
 abandonment of the Luton port. The enemy is probably expecting us already and that is
 why we have to get ready for the intense defence at the beginning of the mission already. As
 soon as the liquidation of the coastal towers will be done, your task is to break through the
 defence and to move inland. There is a minor zone of military bases several miles from the
 coast. We need to occupy these bases as well, because we count on their use next time.
