#> Although we have had some problems, we were still able to fulfil the order to liquidate the
 base Setrix west from Lebaran. We succeeded to unable the access of Consortium's units to
 the Toricon's territories - especially to the forbidden Zone. The connection between Setrix
 and Kytan was destroyed during the fight. The railways were blown up by the
 Consortium's units. We are in the control of the situation.
