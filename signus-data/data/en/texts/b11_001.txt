#> Welcome to the Tridi Vision war news...
#> ■
#> Introductory: the actual view of the positions of both sides:
#> Losabo: after ten weeks the Toricon's navy has finally succeeded to break through the
 continental blockade and to liquidate a main part of the besieging ships. The situation in
 the area of Losaba is under control.
#> Hedar: even here Toricon is slowly capturing it's original territories. This morning several
 areas by the coast were captured by the Toricon's top units. Only the middle parts of the
 Hedar provenience are left to be captured. It is probably only a question of time when the
 Consortium definitely looses the influence over these areas.
#> Lebrukon and Dalio: According to our reporter it looks like there was a ruinous hurricane running across these
 proveniences...
#> The craters from the bombs, fire, burning wrecks, dead soldiers and citizens. One word to
 define: destruction.
#> The public of the whole world denounces the rough attack of Toricon. Toricon mentions the
 Consortium's alleged invasion to the Lebaran's area as a reason for this act. The civil
 citizens pulled involuntarily into the war or gigantic corporations can only ask: How far are
 they willing to go?
