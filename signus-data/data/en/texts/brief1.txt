#> Our intelligence units found out that Consortium is trying to develop a new and considerably
 better type of tank. It's aim will probably be to fight in the war units that are similar to the type of
 Signus#002 commando. It is necessary to find out as much as possible about this tank and give the
 information to the scientific section.
#> The recent army action was successful. One specimen of the tank was captured and it was
 immediately researched carefully. Nevertheless, our knowledge about the project Perseus#001 Beta#001 is
 still not complete. There was a decision made that the tank needs to be tested in a real action.
 Yesterday (23. 2.) during a routine air reconnaissance a secret base of Consortium was revealed
 on the west cost of Arvish province. The pictures clearly show a pair of Betas parking nearby.
 #p.brmap1.152.128.
#> The task of the striking force is to disembark on the coast in the west from the base, to capture it
 and to break the relevant resistance of the Consortium's army. According to the research the
 concentration of forces is not too high in the territory. If you move fast enough, you will probably
 occupy the base sooner than it will be evacuated by Consortium.
#> The transport to the action territory is arranged by the transport navy of the army.
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> THE PRIMARY AIM : to eliminate the enemy army forces in the territory
#> THE SECONDARY AIM : to occupy the base of Consortium and capture tanks Perseus Beta.
