#> The Kentaur Base
#> In the present situation any occurrence of enemy basis in the neighbourhood of Kentaur means a
 potential danger for us. Therefore the HQ of the Toricon society has decided that we will be safer
 if we get to control these bases. Especially Arten to the north-east and Sanukor at the west.
 According to our reporters both these basis are held by the units of Consortium, that is why action
 needs to be done with a lightning speed and not to let the reinforcements from the basis nearby
 surprise us.
#> Arten is the first on the list. It is connected with Sanukor with a railway, which is a plus for us
 because we can use it and apply our recently developed army train Olymp#001. We will construct this
 train from the parts of Arten´s workshops and we will use the Signus commandos to transport the
 needed arsenal as quickly as possible .
#> It is significant to capture Arten and attack Sanukor before they get to know about our arrival.
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> THE PRIMARY AIM : To win the basis Arten and Sanukor
#> THE SECONDARY AIM : To get the documentation on the possible discoveries and to stow up
 of the artefacts found by Consortium.
